# 🛍 NovaMart – Case Study: Preserving Institutional Memory with RAG  

## 🌟 Background  

**NovaMart** is a leading retail chain with a rich history spanning decades. Over the years, the company has accumulated **massive institutional knowledge** — from operational procedures and product insights to customer behavior patterns.  

However, NovaMart faces a **critical challenge**:  

> Many senior employees with **long institutional memory are retiring** or leaving for greener pastures.  
> This has resulted in **knowledge gaps, lack of continuity**, and **loss of valuable company data**.

## 📌 The Problem  

- Knowledge is **scattered across documents, spreadsheets, emails, and legacy systems**.  
- New employees often **reinvent solutions** that were already discovered by previous teams.  
- Decisions are delayed due to **missing context** or reliance on a few senior experts.  
- There is **no centralized way** to store and retrieve institutional knowledge efficiently.

## 💡 The Opportunity  

To **retain institutional memory**, NovaMart wants to implement a **smart knowledge management system**:  

- Centralized storage of company data and documents  
- Intelligent retrieval of relevant information on demand  
- Context-aware answers for employees based on company history  
- Scalable solution that grows with the company  

**Solution Approach:** Build a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system** using the **LLAMA stack**, enabling NovaMart to store, search, and query company knowledge efficiently.

4. **Scalable & Future-Proof**  
   - Build the system to easily incorporate **new data and AI improvements**.
